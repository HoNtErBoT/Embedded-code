# FLASK Python 
Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python that simplifies the process of building web applications. It provides the tools and structure needed to create web applications quickly and efficiently. Flask is known for its simplicity and minimalism, allowing developers to choose the components and extensions they need, making it easy to get started with web development. It follows the WSGI standard, making it compatible with various web servers. Flask is widely used for building web applications, APIs, and prototypes due to its simplicity and versatility.


##  Sample Flask Web Application

```diff
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def home():
    return "Hellow World"


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
This Python code is a basic example of a web application using the Flask framework. Here's a simplified explanation of what it does:

- from flask import Flask: This line imports the Flask class from the Flask library, allowing you to create a web application.

- app = Flask(__name__): An instance of the Flask class is created and named "app." This instance represents your web application.

- @app.route("/"): This is a decorator in Python that tells Flask which URL should trigger the following function. In this case, when a user accesses the root URL ("/"), the home() function will be executed.

- def home():: Defines a Python function called "home" that will be executed when someone visits the root URL.

- return "Hello World": Inside the "home" function, the text "Hello World" is returned as a response. This text will be displayed in the user's web browser when they visit the root URL.

- if __name__ == '__main__':: This conditional statement checks whether the script is being run directly (not imported as a module in another script).

- app.run(debug=True): If the script is run directly, Flask's built-in development server starts, and the web application becomes accessible locally. The debug=True argument enables debugging mode, which provides helpful error messages during development.

In summary, this code sets up a basic Flask web application that responds with "Hello World" when you visit the root URL. When you run the script, it starts a development server, allowing you to access and test the application locally.
