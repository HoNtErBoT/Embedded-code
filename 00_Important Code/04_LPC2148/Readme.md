ARM is generally known as Advanced RISC Machine, in the family of **Reduced Instruction Set Computer** (RISC) .  Arm Ltd. develops the architectures and licenses them to other companies, who design their own products that implement one or more of those architectures, including system on a chip (SoC) and system on module (SOM) designs, that incorporate different components such as memory, interfaces, and radios. It also designs cores that implement these instruction set architectures and licenses these designs to many companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products.

Due to their low costs, minimal power consumption, and lower heat generation than their competitors, ARM processors are desirable for light, portable, battery-powered devices, including smartphones, laptops and tablet computers, and other embedded systems. However, ARM processors are also used for desktops and servers, including the world's fastest supercomputer (Fugaku) from 2020. With over 230 billion ARM chips produced, as of 2022, ARM is the most widely used family of **instruction set architectures** (ISA) and the ISAs produced in the largest quantity.
