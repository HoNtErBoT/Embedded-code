# PIC16F877A Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC)

Analogue to Digital Converter, or ADC, is a data converter which allows digital circuits to interface with the real world by encoding an analogue signal into a binary code
The Analogue-to-Digital Converter, (ADCs) allow micro-processor controlled circuits, Arduinos, Raspberry Pi, and other such digital logic circuits to communicate with the real world.
 In the real world, analogue signals have continuously changing values which come from various sources and sensors which can measure sound, light, temperature or movement, and many digital systems interact with their environment by measuring the analogue signals from such transducers.
