- PIC16F877a is a 40-pin PIC Microcontroller
- It is designed using RISC architecture
- Manufactured by Microchip and is used in Embedded Projects.
- It has five Ports on it, starting from Port A to Port E.
- It has three Timers in it, two of which are 8-bit Timers while 1 is of 16 Bit.
- It supports many communication protocols like
  - Serial Protocol
  - Parallel Protocol.
  - I2C Protocol.
- It supports both hardware pin interrupts and timer interrupts.
- In order to provide frequency to PIC Microcontroller, we use a crystal oscillator and for PIC16F877a, you can use a crystal oscillator of frequency range from 4MHz to 40MHz.

# Introduction of MPLAB
The MPLAB X IDE is the new graphical, integrated debugging tool set for all of Microchip’s more than 800 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit MCUs and digital signal controllers, and memory devices.

It includes a feature-rich editor, source-level debugger, project manager, software simulator, and supports Microchip’s popular hardware tools, such as the MPLAB ICD 3 in-circuit debugger, PICkit™ 3, and MPLAB PM3 programmer.
#  Create a Project
- MPLAB is a standard Windows application and started by clicking on the program icon.

- To create a new project, From **"File"** select **"New Project"** 
- Project Wizard opens . This opened a standard Windows dialog that asks you for choose project select **"Standalone Project"** from **"Microchip Embedded"**.
