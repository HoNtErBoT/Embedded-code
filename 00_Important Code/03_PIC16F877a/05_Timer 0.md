# PIC16F877A timer
	The Timer is used to measure the time or generate an accurate time delay. The microcontroller can also generate/measure the required time delays by running loops, but the timer/counter relieves the CPU from that redundant and repetitive task, allowing it to allocate maximum processing time for other tasks. It is an important application in an embedded system. It maintains the timing of operation in sync with a system clock or an external clock. The timer is used to count cycles and perform a particular action at a specified moment or optionally start an interrupt cycle. The digital cycles counted by the timer can be supplied internally through the peripheral clock or externally through a crystal
Timer is nothing but a simple binary counter that can be configured to count clock pulses (Internal/External). Once it reaches the Max value, it will roll back to zero setting up an Overflow flag and generates the interrupt if enabled.
