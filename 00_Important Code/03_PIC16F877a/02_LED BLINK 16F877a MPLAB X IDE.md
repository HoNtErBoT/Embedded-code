# LED BLINK 16F877a MPLAB X IDE

PIC 16F877a has normally five input/output ports. They are used for the input/output interfacing with other devices/circuits. Most of these port pins are multiplexed for handling alternate function for peripheral features on the devices. All ports in a PIC chip are bi-directional.
## PORT A and the TRIS A Registers
PORT A is a 6-bit wide bi-directional port, the direction of this port is controlled by TRIS  A data direction register. Setting a TRIS A (=1) makes corresponding PORT A pin as an input, clearing the TRIS A (=0) making the corresponding PORT A pin as an output
Pin RA4 is multiplexed with the “Timer0” module clock input to become the RA4/T0CKI pin and functioning either input/output operation or Timer 0 clock functioning module. The RA4/T0CKI pin is a Schmitt Trigger input and an open-drain output. All other PORT A pins have TTL input levels and full CMOS output drivers.
Other PORT A pins in this microcontroller multiplexed with analog inputs and the analog VREF input for both the A/D converters and the comparators. The operation of each pin is selected by clearing/setting the appropriate control bits in the ADCON1 and/or CMCON registers. The TRIS A register controls the direction of the PORT pins even when they are being used as analog inputs. The user must ensure the bits in the TRISA register are maintained set when using them as analog inputs.
