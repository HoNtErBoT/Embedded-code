# LED BLINK 16F877a MPLAB X IDE

PIC 16F877 series normally has five input/output ports. They are used for the input/output interfacing with other devices/circuits. Most of these port pins are multiplexed for handling alternate function for peripheral features on the devices. All ports in a PIC chip are bi-directional. When the peripheral action is enabled in a pin, it may not be used as its general input/output functions. The PIC 16F877 chip basically has 5 input/output ports.
