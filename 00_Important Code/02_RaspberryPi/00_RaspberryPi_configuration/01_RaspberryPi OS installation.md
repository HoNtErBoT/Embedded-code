# RaspberryPi OS installation
We have to install an operating on raspberryPi before start using it, we can install lots of operating system on raspberrypi depending on our requirement.Here we are discussing how to install a rasbian(offecial) OS in to RaspberryPi  


##    Step-1  -> Download OS file from **RapberryPi offecial page**
  To download and install Rasbian or any other OS to raspberryPi we have to open RapberryPi offecial page(**https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/**) in our web browser

<br><br>
In raspberryPi offecial page we can find an Imager software called **Raspberry Pi Imager** ,whith the help of this software we can image OS in to a memory card more fast and reliably, Download the software

##    Step-3  -> Configure advanced options in Raspberry Pi Imager
<br>
If we dont have a monitor,keyboard and mouse for our raspberrypi then these options will help us to configure SSH and WiFi connection during OS installation. Here from the settings we can choose nesessory tab to configure advanced settings on rasbian

##    Step-4  -> Choose storage and write OS into memory card
<br>
Finally we have to choose a storage location to write OS in to the system, generally we use a class-10 (high speed memory card).
