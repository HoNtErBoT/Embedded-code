OpenCV, or Open Source Computer Vision Library, is a popular open-source library in Python and C++ that helps computers understand and process visual information like images and videos, just like how we humans do. It provides various tools and functions to perform tasks like detecting faces, recognizing objects, blurring images, enhancing photo quality, and even creating filters for social media apps. It’s widely used in fields like robotics, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and even by hobbyists to make projects that involve cameras or any visual processing. OpenCV is like a handy toolkit for making computers see and understand the world visually, and it’s free and open for everyone to use, which makes it great for students, developers, and researchers.
