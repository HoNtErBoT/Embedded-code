HC-05 is a Bluetooth module which is designed for wireless comunication.This HC05 bluetooth serial module, 
it allow all serial enabled devices to communicate with each other using Bluetooth.



1.  Key/EN: It is used to bring Bluetooth module in AT commands mode. If Key/EN pin is set to high, then this 
    module will work in command mode. Otherwise by default it is in data mode. The default baud rate of HC-05 
    in command mode is 38400bps and 9600 in data mode.

    HC-05 module has two modes,

          1.  Data mode: Exchange of data between devices.

          2.  Command mode: It uses AT commands which are used to change setting of HC-05. To send these commands to module serial (USART) port is used.

2.  VCC: Connect 5 V or 3.3 V to this Pin.

3.  GND: Ground Pin of module.

4.  TXD: Transmit Serial data (wirelessly received data by Bluetooth module transmitted out serially on TXD pin)

5.  RXD: Receive data serially (received data will be transmitted wirelessly by Bluetooth module).

6.  State: It tells whether module is connected or not.
