# Arduino UNO
The Arduino UNO is one of the most popular Arduino board.  Arduino UNO uses ATmega328P microcontroller as the main control and processing unit of the board. The Atmega328P has 32kB In-System Programmable Flash Memory, 1kB EEPROM, and 2kB internal SRAM.
The UNO board provides access to 14 Digital I/O pins (0-13). Of these 14 digital I/O pins, 6 pins can be used as PWM pins (pins 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 and 11). The PWM pins are indicated by ~ before the pin number on the Arduino UNO boards (E.g. ~3).
