#Arduino SR04 Ultrasonic sensor interface

The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to measure distance to an object. 
It offers excellent range accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package.
It operation is not affected by sunlight or black material like Sharp rangefinders
are (soft materials like cloth can be difficult to detect).
