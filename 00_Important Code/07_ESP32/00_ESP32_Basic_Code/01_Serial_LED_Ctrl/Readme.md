# ESP32 LED Blink

The code shown here is designed to run on an ESP32 microcontroller, which is a powerful and popular choice for IoT (Internet of Things) and embedded system projects due to its Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities.
This ESP32 code is designed to control an LED connected to GPIO pin 23, making it blink on and off at 1-second intervals. When the ESP32 starts, the setup() function runs first, where the serial communication is initialized using Serial.begin(115200); at a baud rate of 115200. This serial interface allows the ESP32 to communicate with a computer through the Serial Monitor, which is part of the Arduino IDE. It sends and receives text data, making it a crucial tool for debugging and monitoring the program's behavior in real-time. The message "Hello, ESP32!" is sent to the Serial Monitor to confirm that the code has started executing. Additionally, pin 23 is set as an output using pinMode(23, OUTPUT);. The loop() function, which runs repeatedly, turns the LED on by sending a HIGH signal to pin 23 and simultaneously sends the message "LED ON" to the Serial Monitor. After a 1-second delay (delay(1000);), the LED is turned off by sending a LOW signal to pin 23, and the message "LED OFF" is sent to the Serial Monitor. Another 1-second delay follows before the loop repeats. This continuous loop makes the LED blink while allowing you to monitor the status of the LED in real-time through the Serial Monitor, providing a simple yet effective demonstration of basic ESP32 functionality and serial communication.
