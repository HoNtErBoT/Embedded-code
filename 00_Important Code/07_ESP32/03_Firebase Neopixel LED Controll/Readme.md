# NeoPixel LED Controll using Firebase

This project involves controlling a NeoPixel LED strip connected to an ESP32 using an Android app built with MIT App Inventor. The app allows users to generate and select different color codes, which are then sent to Firebase. The ESP32 retrieves the color codes from Firebase and changes the LED colors accordingly. This setup enables real-time control of the LED strip through the Android app, showcasing the integration of IoT, mobile development, and cloud-based data management.
